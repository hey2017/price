# Stock price forecasting 
Stock price forecasting
In this project I create an app which you can predict the price of stocks for specific future time frames.  

## Technical requirements
For this analysis you need to have python installed and have the following libraries:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Propeht](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)
- [yahoo finance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)

## Run the code
To run the code, you can use the file ```myapp5.py``` in your python editor. Since this code is an app you need to deploy it by streamlit. 
If you need information on installing the streamlit by anaconda please visit: -[streamlit installation by anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/streamlit).
